One descriptor variable available
in the fast food data set is the extent to which consumers love or hate McDonald’s.
Using a simple mosaic plot, we can visualise the association between segment
membership and loving or hating McDonald’
we first extract the segment membership for each consumer for the
four-segment solution. Next we cross-tabulate segment membership and the love hate variable. 
Finally, we generate the mosaic plot with cells colours indicating the
deviation of the observed frequencies in each cell from the expected frequency.

The Mosaic plot reveals a strong
and significant association between those two variables. Members of segment 1
(depicted in the first column) rarely express love for McDonald’s, as indicated by
the top left boxes being coloured in red.
members of segment 4 are. At the same time, these consumers are less likely
to hate McDonald’s. Members of segment 2 appear to have the strongest negative feelings
towards McDonald’s; their likelihood of hating McDonald’s is extremely high.



The fast food data contains a few other basic descriptor variables, such as gender
and age.
The mosaic plot offers the following additional insights
about our market segments: segment 1 and segment 3 have a similar gender
distribution as the overall sample. Segment 2 contains significantly more men (as
depicted by the larger blue box for the category male, and the smaller red box for
the category female in the second column of the plot). Members of segment 4 are
significantly less likely to be men (smaller red box at the top of the fourth column)


Because age is metric – rather than categorical – we use a parallel box-and whisker plot to assess the association of age with segment membership.
